# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kulacino a.k.a _Ayu W_. I live around Bogor, West Java, Indonesia with my partner and four :cat: cats: `Yi, Sun, Shin, and Miny`.

## Projects and Creations
Lately, I'm interested in building some static site themes for Jekyll and Hugo. Even though I don't really have a sense in UI/UX or web design, I'm still trying to build them. I also practice CI/CD in order to deploy the site easily after merged.

Here is my ongoing theme projects:

- [**Bajawa:** A Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/kulacino/bajawa)
- [**AvidReader:** Jekyll Theme for Book Blogger](https://github.com/kulacino/avidreader)

Other projects (mostly scripts):

- Simple [apache-stack auto-install](https://github.com/kulacino/apache-auto-install).
- [Image Optimizer](https://github.com/kulacino/s3-image-optimizer).
- [Ansible database dumper](https://github.com/kulacino/ansible-database-dumper), can be used inside Ansible AWX too.
- [Dockerpool](https://github.com/kulacino/Dockerpool), _pun from Deadpool_ :joy:. It's a collection of `Dockerbuild` files.
- Simple [web-server-installer](https://github.com/kulacino/web-server-installer) to install various web server stack (_last update: Dec 5, 2017_).
- Various bots (will be uploaded soon if i'm not lazy). XD
