## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kulacino. In Indonesian, **Kulacino** means _water marks on the table surface due to cold or wet glass on it_. Due to my habit in excessive iced-coffee drinking, I often left those "kulacino" on the table. I'm a professional coffee drinker, ~~that's why~~. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Currently, I'm working as a DevOps Engineer. Living around Bogor, West Java, Indonesia with my cats, "Yi, Sun, and Shin".
